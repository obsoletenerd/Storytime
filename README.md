# Storytime

A quick and dirty LLM-based story generator for my kids.

Absolutely not ready for production but "works on my machine".

I host this on a Raspberry Pi so I can access it from my phone when tucking them in, and it talks to Ollama on my desktop to locally/privately generate stories. If my desktop isn't turned on, we can optionally select Mistral/Anthropic/OpenAI as alternate generation sources via the modular system included.

Also optionally generates images using OpenAI image generation, then inserts them at the end of the story.
