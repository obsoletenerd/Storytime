3. Friendship Tale: Character meets new friends and they have several adventures together
4. Magic Discovery: Character finds something magical that leads to multiple magical experiences
5. Problem-Solving Story: Character faces a problem that requires several creative attempts to solve

- Include dialogue to bring characters to life

Here is what the user gave you to try and use in the story.
Don't feel like you need to use all of it, but weave in what you can naturally.

"""


IMAGE_SUMMARY_PROMPT = """
Based on the following story, create a brief description for an image that would be perfect to accompany this story.

Keep the description under 200 characters and focus on visual elements that would delight a 6-12 year old (not toddler).
Do not include any text or words in the image.
Do not include any children in the picture, but instead focus on characters and elements of the story so they can imagine themselves in it.

Story:
"""
